An Unusual Window
by Galileo Cappella

Do you know how sometimes we notice something that was always there but we just didn't see it?
This boy didn't feel that at all, he KNEW that this wasn't normal. He knew that windows didn't work this way.
Windows are supposed to show you the things that are behind them. Maybe with a stain or two blurring those things, but all windows work like that. He'd learned that back in first grade, around the same time he learned where his head, shoulders, knees and toes (knees and toes) were.
But THIS window was now doing something different. It was showing him a face.
While it seemed familiar, he couldn't place it. The face seemed rather suprized to see him, maybe it was also expecting to see through it's window.
This didn't make sense, that was a window, like all windows it had glass and was placed on a wall. Though unusual, this window was placed on the bathroom wall.
He wanted to see the face's room. So he told it to move out of the way, the face didn't. He took his tongue out, the face copied him. That annoyed the boy, was the face insulting him? Or maybe it comunicated through face language (made sense, since faces on windows can't talk)?
